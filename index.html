            <h2>This Challenge is to Routers what TodoMVC is to MV* frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Picking your Router used to be a Hobson's choice. With frameworks like AngularJS or Vue.js, view loading is so complex that it has to be baked into the Router. React fixes this by moving the views out of the HTML and into the JavaScript. Now you can use any Router you want. This project helps you pick the one that's right for you by offering the same Music Catalog SPA built in React using different Routers<superscript>*</superscript>:
